# Machine_learning_cousera
 
- This folder holds practicing exercices of `Coursera Machine Learning course` provided by `Andrew Ng (Standford University)`
- The exercices are with the objectives of `implementing the algorithms` and `applying them to typical use cases`. All codes are realized in Matlab
- Machine Learning algorithms and topics included here are: 
     - Supervised learning: linear regression, logistic regression, Neural networks, SVM
     - Unsupervised learning: PCA, K means clustering
     - Machine learning topics: regularzation, bias-variance tradeoff, imbalanced dataset, recommender systems
