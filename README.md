# Machine_learning_cousera
 
- This folder holds practicing exercices of Coursera Machine Learning course provided by Andrew Ng (Standford University)
- The exercices are with the objectives of realizing the algorithms and applying them to typical use cases. All codes are realized in Matlab
> - Machine Learning algorithms included here are: 
>     - Supervised learning: linear regression, logistic regression, Neural networks, SVM, kernel 
>     - Unsupervised learning: PCA, K means clustering
>     - Machine learning topics: penalization, bias-variance tradeoff, imbalanced dataset, recommender systems
